## ðŸŒŸ Overview

SwarmSense is a fully decentralized grant proposal evaluation system that combines Coinbase Developer Platform (CDP) for blockchain interactions with GAIAnet Swarm's decentralized AI models. The system leverages multiple decentralized components to ensure fair, transparent, and automated evaluation of blockchain project proposals with seamless on-chain execution capabilities.

## ðŸŽ¯ Problem It Solves

- **Decentralized Grant Evaluation**: Traditional grant evaluation systems are centralized and often biased. Our solution uses a combination of decentralized AI models and popular SOTA models (GAIAnet Swarm and XAI) to provide fair and transparent evaluations.
- **Automated Milestone Tracking**: Smart contract-based milestone evaluation system that automatically triggers token distributions and rewards based on AI-powered assessments.
- **Multi-Model Consensus**: Utilizes both GAIAnet Swarm and XAI models to achieve consensus in proposal evaluation, ensuring more reliable and unbiased results.
- **Seamless Blockchain Integration**: Leverages Coinbase Developer Platform (CDP) for simplified on-chain actions like token creation, ETH transfers, and NFT minting, making the system more accessible and efficient.

## ðŸš€ Key Features

### CDP SDK Integration
- Automated asset management using CDP's transfer capabilities
- Automated NFT minting triggered by AI milestone verification
- Smart token creation system that automatically deploys ERC-20 tokens for successful grants

### Dual AI Model Architecture
1. GAIAnet Swarm's decentralized AI models for primary evaluation
2. XAI integration for cross-validation and enhanced decision-making
3. Multi-model consensus mechanism for unbiased grant assessments

### Advanced AI Features
- In-context learning-based prompt engineering for proposal analysis
- Machine learning-based scoring system for technical feasibility
- Automated milestone tracking and verification
- AI-driven fund disbursement and token creation
